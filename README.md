## dart_mmd

A set of utilities to read MikuMikuDance formats for Flutter and Dart projects. Includes a reference implementation of an application that can load and display MMD models and sequences.

## Developing

You need the [FVM](https://fvm.app/) tool to manage the Flutter SDK version. After installing it, run `fvm install` to install the correct version of the Flutter SDK.

The parser doesn't need a full Flutter installation, so you can run the tests with `dart test` or `flutter test`.

## Project Status

This project is still in development. Currently it's not functional but the base classes should be feature-complete for partial use
in your custom implementation.
